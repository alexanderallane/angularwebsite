        <p>This site is owned and operated by Alexander Allan Escobal, an IT college student. He is studying at AMA Computer College, a school located in Pasig City. He created this web application for his thesis and to help his fellow students to determine the right course and colleges they should go in.
           It was developed to improve the quality of secondary education graduates entering college. It aims to maintain the highest quality of education by leading the flow of students to courses in post-secondary institutions of learning matching their aptitude to promote national development. 
           The purpose of the test is to help students determine which courses they should study in college and what sort of career they are best suited for. Like many standardized tests, it measures students' general scholastic knowledge. It also tests vocational aptitude, occupational preferences and entrepreneurial skills. One of the reasons it was developed was to address the issue of unemployment due to workers getting mismatched with the wrong careers. The hope is that by determining which careers they are ideally suited for, students can plan a course of study that will give them the skills and education they will need for their ideal careers. 
           This test results are only one part of the bigger picture in determining the best career fit for a student. Students shouldn't make major decisions based on the test results alone. Their own goals and interests should be considered when deciding on a course of study and a career.
